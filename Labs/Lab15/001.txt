float peso;
peso = 30;
cout << peso;
delete peso;

------------------------

Answer: No, because peso is not an dynamic allocated memory + it's not a pointer; 
if it were a pointer the code would run, but later on it could return an error, since
the deleted memory is returned to the OS to other things, and since a program is not allowed to access
parts of memory it doesn't have access, the OS crashes it.
